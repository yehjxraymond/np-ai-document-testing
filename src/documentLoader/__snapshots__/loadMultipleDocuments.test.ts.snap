Annex A



Terms and Conditions for Data Disclosure



1. Security



The contractor shall take all reasonable measures to ensure that personal data held in connection with this agreement is protected against loss, and against unauthorised access, use, modification, disclosure or other misuse in accordance with the specifications set out in the Gebiz Specification Form (GSF) , and that only authorised personnel have access to the data.



The contractor shall not vary the specifications set out in GSF without the prior written approval of the agency.



Explanation :

A schedule setting out the required specifications may be attached. The nature and extent of these will vary depending on the circumstances of the contract. More stringent controls might be needed where sensitive personal data is involved or where the contractor has direct access to databases held by the agency.



2. Use



The contractor shall use any personal data held in connection with this agreement only for the purposes of fulfilling its obligations under this agreement.



3. Disclosure



The contractor shall not disclose any personal data obtained in connection with this agreement without the written authority of the agency. The contractor shall immediately notify the agency when it becomes aware that a disclosure of personal data may be required by law.



Explanation :

Although the contractor may have a legal duty to disclose personal data, the contractor should inform the agency of any request for information as early as possible. This will enable the agency to obtain any relevant advice as to the legality of the request and to intervene in any proceedings before any disclosure is made.



4. Transfer of personal data outside Singapore

The contractor shall not transfer personal data held in connection with this agreement outside Singapore, or allow parties outside Singapore to have access to it, without the prior approval of the agency.



Explanation :

While this form of disclosure is covered by clause 3 (on Disclosure), there may be value in stating this restriction specifically because of the high risk associated with trans-border flows of data. Generally, once data goes beyond Singapore’s borders, it may be either impractical or impossible for an agency to prevent any unauthorised use or disclosure of that data.



5. Employee awareness of data protection requirements and undertakings

The contractor shall ensure that any employee of the contractor or any subcontractor requiring access to any personal data held in conjunction with this agreement makes an undertaking in writing not to access, use, disclose or retain personal data except in performing their duties of employment and is informed that failure to comply with this undertaking may be a criminal offence and may also lead the contractor to take disciplinary action against the employee.



6. Advising the agency of any breach of the data protection clause

The contractor shall in respect of any personal data held in connection with this agreement immediately notify the agency where the contractor becomes aware of a breach of clauses [Clause 1 to 5 above] by itself or any subcontractor.







Explanation :

The contractor has an obligation to immediately notify the agency where it becomes aware that, through one of its employees, it has breached the contractual provisions relating to security, unauthorised disclosure and unauthorised use, and also where an employee has had access to personal information without having signed the necessary undertaking.



7. Reasonable requests, directions and guidelines

The contractor shall in respect of any personal data held in connection with this agreement cooperate with any reasonable requests, directions or guidelines of the agency [or agency’s delegate] arising in connection with the handling of personal data.



8. Ensuring clauses have effect after the contract has ended

Clause 1 to 7 shall continue to have effect after the termination or completion of the agreement.



Explanation :

Even though contracts should normally provide for all personal data to be returned at the end of the agreement or be destroyed, it is wise to ensure that, should any personal data inadvertently remain with the contractor, the protection that existed during the agreement continues to have effect after the agreement has ended. In addition, where a breach comes to light after the agreement has ended, the relevant clauses should also continue to apply.



9. Sub-contracting



In an event that sub-contracting is necessary, written authority from Ngee Ann Polytechnic has to be obtained before data can be disclosed. There should be an agreement between the contractor and sub-contractor to ensure that protection of personal data.



10. Secure erasure/destruction of data upon completion of the contract



Upon completion of the contract, the Contractor shall return all materials received or generated under this Contract (including approved photocopied materials) and perform secure erasure/destruction of data.

Annex A 
 
Terms and Conditions for Data Disclosure 
 
1. Security 
 
The contractor shall take all reasonable measures to ensure that personal data held in connection with 
this agreement is protected against loss, and against unauthorised access, use, modification, disclosure 
or other misuse in accordance with the specifications set out in the Gebiz Specification Form (GSF) , 
and that only authorised personnel have access to the data. 
 
The contractor shall not vary the specifications set out in GSF without the prior written approval of the 
agency. 
 
Explanation : 
A schedule setting out the required specifications may be attached. The nature and extent of these will 
vary depending on the circumstances of the contract. More stringent controls might be needed where 
sensitive personal data is involved or where the contractor has direct access to databases held by the 
agency. 
 
2. Use 
 
The contractor shall use any personal data held in connection with this agreement only for the purposes 
of fulfilling its obligations under this agreement. 
 
3. Disclosure 
 
The contractor shall not disclose any personal data obtained in connection with this agreement without 
the written authority of the agency. The contractor shall immediately notify the agency when it becomes 
aware that a disclosure of personal data may be required by law. 
 
Explanation : 
Although the contractor may have a legal duty to disclose personal data, the contractor should inform 
the agency of any request for information as early as possible. This will enable the agency to obtain 
any relevant advice as to the legality of the request and to intervene in any proceedings before any 
disclosure is made. 
 
4. Transfer of personal data outside Singapore 
The  contractor  shall  not  transfer  personal  data  held  in  connection  with  this agreement  outside 
Singapore, or allow parties outside Singapore to have access to it, without the prior approval of the 
agency. 
 
Explanation : 
While this form of disclosure is covered by clause 3 (on Disclosure), there may be value in stating this 
restriction specifically because of the high risk associated with trans-border flows of data. Generally, 
once data goes beyond Singapore’s borders, it may be either impractical or impossible for an agency 
to prevent any unauthorised use or disclosure of that data. 
 
5. Employee awareness of data protection requirements and undertakings 
The contractor shall ensure that any employee of the contractor or any subcontractor requiring access 
to any personal data held in conjunction with this agreement makes an undertaking in writing not to 
access, use, disclose or retain personal data except in performing their duties of employment and is 
informed that failure to comply with this undertaking may be a criminal offence and may also lead the 
contractor to take disciplinary action against the employee. 
 
6. Advising the agency of any breach of the data protection clause 
The contractor shall in respect of any personal data held in connection with this agreement immediately 
notify the agency where the contractor becomes aware of a breach of clauses [Clause 1 to 5 above] by 
itself or any subcontractor. 
 
 
 

 
PS037-RFQ  Updated: 21 April 2023 
                    Official (Closed) - Non Sensitive 
Explanation : 
The contractor has an obligation to immediately notify the agency where it becomes aware that, through 
one of its employees, it has breached the contractual provisions relating to security, unauthorised 
disclosure and unauthorised use, and also where an employee has had access to personal information 
without having signed the necessary undertaking. 
 
7. Reasonable requests, directions and guidelines 
The contractor shall in respect of any personal data held in connection with this agreement cooperate 
with any reasonable requests, directions or guidelines of the agency [or agency’s delegate] arising in 
connection with the handling of personal data. 
 
8. Ensuring clauses have effect after the contract has ended 
Clause 1 to 7 shall continue to have effect after the termination or completion of the agreement. 
 
Explanation : 
Even though contracts should normally provide for all personal data to be returned at the end of the 
agreement or be destroyed, it is wise to ensure that, should any personal data inadvertently remain with 
the contractor, the protection that existed during the agreement continues to have effect after the 
agreement has ended. In addition, where a breach comes to light after the agreement has ended, the 
relevant clauses should also continue to apply. 
 
9. Sub-contracting 
 
In an event that sub-contracting is necessary, written authority from Ngee Ann Polytechnic has to be 
obtained before data can be disclosed. There should be an agreement between the contractor and sub-
contractor to ensure that protection of personal data. 
 
10. Secure erasure/destruction of data upon completion of the contract 
 
Upon completion of the contract, the Contractor shall return all materials received or generated under 
this Contract (including approved photocopied materials) and perform secure erasure/destruction of 
data.  "
